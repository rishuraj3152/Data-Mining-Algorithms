# Decision_tree
Python implementation of decision tree

The code is solely based on the given dataset, and it is quite easy to make it work for other datasets. Recursion calls has been done manually to see the things happening inside of the tree clearly. The ALGO is based on ID3 as it uses Entropy for attribute selection. One having highest information gain acts as an attribute for that time.

The description of the dataset is as follows:
Buying: vhigh, high, med, low
Maint: vhigh, high, med, low
Doors: 2, 3, 4, 5more
Persons: 2, 4, more
Lug boot: small, med, big
Safety: low, med, big

Class Labels: unacc,acc,good,vgood

Few more recursion needs to be done at the end to get the final classification, however things will start to reveal clearly once you get into the code.

Happy learning :)
